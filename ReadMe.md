# Welcome to Barrels R Us

This is a project I am building to experiment with theming in Umbraco. I will be attempting to accomplish the following:
- [ ] Implement and use Sass in place of standard CSS.
- [ ] Use Sass variables to dictate the color scheme used by the website.
- [ ] Implement a toggle in the navigation of the site that, when switched, will turn on or off a color scheme that is user-friendly for those that are visually impaired.

## Notes about development environment:
- The site is being built with Umbraco v8.
- jQuery is being used in place of Vanilla JavaScript.
- Some Bootstrap will be implemented, but driving the theme switching will be Sass.
